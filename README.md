## Requirements

* Skript **2.8.0** or higher

> **Note:** Event if DiSky is only based on Skript, some features require Bukkit's or Spigot's API. The 1.13+ version is a more recommended version than a requirement.

## Incompatibilities

* DiscordSRV *(it uses an older version of JDA that DiSky is not based on)*
* any other JDA-compiled plugin, that doesn't have JDA 5 as JDA version.
