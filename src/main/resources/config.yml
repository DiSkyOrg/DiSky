# Debug is disabled by default.

# Because of a Skript parsing issue, the 'online' enumeration value for the bot's status override '%players% is online' condition.
# If you never use this condition, or never experienced an issue like that, do not touch this.
# This will force DiSky to use TEXT and not ENUMERATION for the status, aka:
# 'set online status of bot "name" to ONLINE' will be '... to "online"'
